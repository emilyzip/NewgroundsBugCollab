# The Newgrounds Bug Collab!
 Little pokemon themed Museum game based around a virtual bug zoo, all containment cells are user created and submitted.  
 The Collab was hosted by [Frosty.](https://frosty.newgrounds.com/) I merely handled all this programming/gamedev junk.  

 This repo uses submodules so if you wanna clone it you should use this i think:  
 `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/emilyzip/NewgroundsBugCollab`   
 After you clone you'll have to restart the editor 3 or 4 times without saving for all the assets to import correctly.  
 
 You will have to import these two fonts yourself, they are typically stored in 'root/PrivateData/' 
 [PKMN RBYGSC](https://www.dafont.com/pkmn-rbygsc.font)  
 [Pokemon Classic](https://www.dafont.com/pokemon-classic.font)  
 Before booting up the editor but after putting these font files in, Take the import files from [here](https://github.com/emilyzip/NewgroundsBugCollab/tree/main/FontImports) and place them in the folder with the fonts, this should prevent any issues with crashing.

 I love bugs! ! !  
 and i LOVE YOU ! ! ! <3
