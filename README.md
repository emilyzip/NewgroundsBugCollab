# The Newgrounds Bug Collab!
 Little pokemon themed Museum game based around a virtual bug zoo, all containment cells are user created and submitted.  
 The Collab was hosted by ![Frosty.](https://frosty.newgrounds.com/) I merely handled all this programming/gamedev junk.  

 This repo uses submodules so if you wanna clone it you should use this i think:  
 `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/emilyzip/NewgroundsBugCollab`   
 I'm still new to this whole github thing so please do contact me if there are any insane issues here

 I love bugs! ! !  
 and i LOVE YOU ! ! ! <3
